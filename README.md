This is a collection of small methods wrapped in a class and possibly a module for use in other management scripts.

If you find it useful, please let me know. Feel free to fork and contribute.

I know a bunch of this can be cleaned up or streamlined.

My goal is to help people stop reinventing wheels in daily tasks.

Also, for those of you in the Mac admin community not using configuration management, like [Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com) or [Chef](http://www.opscode.com/), you really should look into them. This library is no substitute for such tools. (I am reinventing some wheels here.)
